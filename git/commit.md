  Commit messages styleguide
</h1>

For myself: Use this!!!

## 🧨 The 7 rules for a commit message [_(Source)_](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit)
* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

## 💖 Symbol for every message
* ✨ for adding new stuff
* 💬 for adding or changing comments
* 📝 for fixing typo
* 🔼 for adding dependencies
* ⬆ for updating dependencies
* 🚮 for removing dependencies
* ✏ for renaming code/files/folders
* 💄 for improving some stuff
* 🐛 for fixing a bug
* 🚚 for moving some files or data
* ❌ for removing something
* 📦 for deploing or packing a new version
* ♻ for refactoring code
* 🧹 for cleaning code
* 💩 for test related stuff
* 📃 for adding/updating/removing dokumentation
